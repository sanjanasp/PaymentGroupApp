# **Split Bills**

### **Introduction**
The application helps make splitting bills easy among a group of friends/roommates. It allows
people to split bills equally or according to how much each one owes. It also shows the
total amount a person has to repay if he/she has outstanding amounts to pay. This
application is useful for friends/roommates who split restaurant, grocery, shopping and other
bills.

This project is of interest to me because I frequently split various kinds of bills with my friends.
Having such an application will help me keep track of the 
amount I owe to different people and pay them back before my debts increase out of control.
