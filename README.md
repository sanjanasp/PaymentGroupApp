# **Payment Group**

### **Introduction**
The application helps to keep track of the amount a person owes to other people and, the amount
others owe to that person. This application is useful for friends/roommates who
split restaurant, grocery, shopping and other bills.

This project is of interest to me because I frequently split various kinds of bills with my friends.
Having such an application will help me keep track of the amount I owe to different people and 
pay them back before my debts increase out of control.
