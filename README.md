# **Payment Group**

### **Introduction**
This application helps the user to keep track of the amount people owe to him/her and, the amount
he/she owes to people in that group. It allows the user to perform
a bunch of functions, for example, add new people in the group, deduct some amount paid or 
received, remove someone and so on. This application is useful for everyone who
split bills and want to keep an account of how much they owe to people and will receive from them

This project is of interest to me because I frequently split various kinds of bills with my friends.
Having such an application will help me keep track of the amount I owe to different people and 
pay them back before my debts increase out of control.
